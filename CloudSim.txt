CloudSim 
	simulate data centers
	creats multiple hosts, VMs and tasks

	data center consist of many hosts, host will do VM scheduling

host -  physical server
	contains multiple VMs(manage them)
		
			Java work

Datacenter class in cloudSim models data center
	contains set of hosts

Host class models physical server
	has memory, storage, etc. as attributes

VM class models Virtual machines 
	instantiated by host

....................sharing policies (for sharing processors with VM)....
VMScheduler (Java class)
if we have 1 processor and 2 VMs.
	space shared - processor is not pre-empted till task is finished.
		processor given to one VM and only given to other VM when first VM is done with it
	time shared - processor switched b/w VMs

.............................................
		Java continued 
Cloudlet models task 
	attributes length = MI million instruction

CloudletSchedulerTimeShared  tasks run concurrently
CloudletSchedulerSpaceShared tasks run sequentially  

..................how cloudSim works
CloudSim.init
create datacenter
create broker
create VMs
create cloudlets
startSimulation
stopSimulation
........................................ imp ...........
Placement of Cloudlets in VMs (scheduling) is done by the Broker (write your own broker),
while placement of VMs on hosts is done by the Datacenter.
=====================
extend broker and implement your own scheduling
